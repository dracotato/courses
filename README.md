# Courses

Your typical courses platform.

## Setup

1. Clone

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dracotato/courses.git
   # or via shh
   git clone git@github.com:dracotato/courses.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies (with uv)

   > see [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
   > for how to install uv

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Add this to a `.env` file in the root directory

   ```bash
   FLASK_APP=src # Specify the module that contains the app factory
   # i.e. the create_app function
   FLASK_DEBUG=1 # Enable debug mode by default
   SECRET_KEY=some-strong-random-key
   ```

4. Initialize the db (be sure to be in the root directory)

   ```bash
   uv run flask init-db
   ```

5. Run the app (also in the root directory)

   ```bash
   uv run flask
   ```

## Contributing

Always push to dev and then create a pull-request to merge into main.

### Commit Message Format

#### Scope

It's up to the writer's judgement, here are some examples:

#### Summary

Use imperative mode in summary
e.g. add instead of added or adds

Make sure it's less than 72 characters
otherwise use multi-line commits. (see below)

#### Examples

- `feat: add a user table to the schema`
- `refactor: modularize utils`
- `fix(ui): remove extra top margin in the submit button`
- Multi-line commits:

  ```
  # multi-line commit
  refactor(schema): remove the username column in the user table

  # body, explain why
  the app doesn't need unique identification

  # footer, can be useful for metadata
  issue #122
  ```

  If you need to include more info,
  add an empty line and write whatever you need. (like above)
